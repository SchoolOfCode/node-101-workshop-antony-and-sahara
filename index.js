// ðŸ‘‰ 2d. Now make a function called `describeCollection` that takes in an array as a parameter. The function should loop through the array, and for each item, it should call the `describeItem` function so it displays a message according to how many you have in your collection.

// Call your function below where you've defined it, handing in the `myCollection` array.

// Run the file again to see the output and check that it outputs the correct message for each item in your collection (i.e. each object in your `myCollection` array).
